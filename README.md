### Ocean Biogeochemial Modelling Environment example data files

## Description
OceanBioME was developed with generous support from the Cambridge Centre for Climate Repair [CCRC](https://www.climaterepair.cam.ac.uk) as a tool to study the effectiveness and impacts of ocean carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies.

OceanBioME is a flexible modelling environment written in Julia for modelling the coupled interactions between ocean biogeochemistry, carbonate chemistry, and physics. OceanBioME can be run as a stand-alone box model, or coupled with Oceananigans.jl to run as a 1D column model or with 3D physics. 

This is data for the code examples included in OceanBioME.jl. Please see these [instructions](https://github.com/sichen-org/OceanBioME.jl) for more information.
